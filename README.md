# Intertwin-hython


## Description
A python package aims to exploit state-of-the-art timeseries forcasting for hydrologic models.


## Installation
This package is currently under development. To download it, you'll need to clone the repository.

```
git clone git@gitlab.inf.unibz.it:REMSEN/intertwin-hython.git
```

## Usage
Please review the workflow notebook for a demonstration of the expected inputs, outputs, and how to use the package.


## Support
Please open an issue if you have a bug, feature request or have an idea to improve the package.

## TODO
[] Implement three types of model validation: space, time and spacetime validation 
[] Develop stratified sampler
[] Plotting functions to visualize model performance
[] 


## Roadmap
1. More preprocessing options: normalization, handling NaNs, ..
2. Hyperparameter Optimization. 
3. Data augmentation.
4. Visualization.
5. Parallel and Distributed ML tasks.
6. Explainable AI.
7. Add more timeseries models like GRU, ARIMA.
